// Implement Insert and Delete methods of Binary Search Tree. You have to follow the template:

// The first line of input contains one integer number N (1 < N < 1000),
// that denote the number of elements in the tree.

// The second line contains N integer numbers (1 < number < 10 000,
// numbers you need to insert in the tree.

// The third line contains one integer number M (1 < M < 10 000),
// that denote number of elements you need to delete from the tree

// The fourth line contains M integer numbers (1 < number < 10 000),
// numbers you need to delete from the tree.

// The fifths line contains one integer number X (1 < X < 1000).

// If X number exists in the tree print "YES", if not print "NO".

class BinarySearchTree {

  // Binary tree stores numbers as elements
  // Implement insertion method
  // return true if insertion is successful
  // return false if element exists in the tree

  // return true if element was deleted from the tree
